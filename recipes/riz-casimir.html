    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This is a classic Swiss dish. It consists of light basmati rice and a sweet chicken and fruit curry sauce.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <p>The following declarations are measured for two portions</p>
    <ul>
        <h3>Rice</h3>
    <li>2 cups of rice</li>  
    <li>4 cups of water</li>  
    <li>Seasoning (salt, pepper, star-anis, cardamon)</li>  
        <h3>Sauce</h3>
    <li>1 banana</li>  
    <li>2 chicken breasts (or any other boneless parts)</li>  
    <li>2 slices of canned pineapple</li>  
    <li>0.5 mango</li>
    <li>1.5 tbsp flower</li>
    <li>4 tbsp of mild curry</li>
    <li>25g of butter</li>
    <li>0.75 litre chicken stock (I like to use Knorr fix stock</li>
    <li>Oil</li>
    <p> <em> Instead of the declared fruits, one might use a canned fruit cocktail. The sirup in which the fruits lay even helps to sweeten the sauce.</em></p> 
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Pour water and rice in a pot, season with salt, pepper, 2 star-anis and 3 cracked cardamon. Turn the heat up to full until the water boils. As soon as it boils, put the heat on 1 or 2 and put the lid on. Let it sit there for 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>While the rice is cooking, slice your chicken & fruits into 1 cm wide slices. Season the sliced chicken with salt an pepper</li>
        <li>Pour some oil in your frying pan and bring it up to heat. Then put your seasoned chicken inside. Cook the chicken until its almost done, then take it out an put in a bowl.</li>
        <li>Put all your fruits in the same frying pan, if needed add oil beforehand. Give the fruits some heat, as to release their sweetness through caramelization. After 2 min. take out and add to the bowl.</li>
        <li>Prepare your chicken stock by boiling 0.75 litres of water and then adding 1.5 cubes of Knorr chicken stock.</li>
        <li>Put your butter in the same frying pan and let it melt on medium heat, then add 4 tbsp of curry and stir. Add your flavour and stir until you get a paste, then add your chicken stock and stir until you get a smooth creamy sauce . </li>
        <li>As soon as the sauce starts to simmer, put the ingredients in the bowl into the sauce.</li>
        <li>Take your rice and get rid of the star-anis and the cardamon, which should have risen to the top. Stir the rice up a little with a fork.</li>
        <li>Now you can plate your dish by putting about 50/50 rice and sauce on the plate. You are ready to serve.</li>
    </ol>
